# GatsbyJS MDX Blog

A personal website and blog for [Martin Guzman](https://www.martin-guzman.com/), a cyber security specialist. 

Built with Gatsby.js and MDX to render JSX / React components in Markdown documents. 

The site is responsive with fluid typography and UI Elements designed and selected to improve accessibility for users with common visual impairment conditions such as dyslexia and colour vision deficiency (CVD).

## UI and Accessibility Features

Content hierarchy is established using structural, semantic HTML and UI Elements; such as font size and weight, white space and underlined text. Users with visual impairments are not dependant on colours. 

### Typographic Elements

To improve readability and assist users with dyslexia, [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) and [PT Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Mono) font families were selected for their clear distinction between the letters; b/d, p/q, f/t, a/o/c and i/l/1.

All caps are were not used to reduce visual stress for dyslexic users.

### Colour Palette

A simple greyscale colour palette was applied to help ensure a cohesive visual experience for users with or without a color vision deficiency (CVD). 

For an accent colour, various tones of purples were applied. Red and green were rejected as they appear confusing and unambiguously distinguishable for a majority of CVD users. 

All text, links and background colours adhered to WCAG 2.1 contrast ratio requirements.
